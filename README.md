# Petful - Client

### Introduction

Petful simulates a web application for pet adoption. The application maintains two queues: one for available dogs and another for available cats.
The application will simulate pet adoption by scrolling through cats and dogs; making each pet available for adoption when the queue reaches the designated user (thinkful)
