# Petful - Client

### Introduction

Petful simulates a web application for pet adoption. The application maintains two queues: one for available dogs and another for available cats.
The application will simulate pet adoption by scrolling through cats and dogs; making each pet available for adoption when the queue reaches the designated user (thinkful)

### How it works
The adoption process works strictly on a "First-In, First-Out" basis. The FIFO is based on the animals that came to the shelter first. People can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but they may only adopt the animal that came to the shelter first is the one to be adopted first. In addition, people who wants to adopt are also put in a Queue so they can adopt when its their turn.
