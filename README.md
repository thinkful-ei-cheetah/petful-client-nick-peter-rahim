# FIFO Pet Adoption Agency - Client

[FIFO PAA Live](https://fifo-paa.now.sh/ "Live App")

### Introduction

FIFO PAA simulates a web application for pet adoption. The server maintains three singly-linked queues: one for available dogs, one for available cats, and another for logged-in users.
The application communicates with the server to update the queues when a pet is adopted and re-renders the updated information received from the backend.
